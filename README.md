# Hello World DApp üëã 
### Full Stack Blockchain Development in English ‚ú®
### Spanish Version: [Hola Mundo DApp](https://github.com/dayana0425/hola-mundo-polygon-y-elgraph)

![Figure 1](./images/HolaMundoScreenshot.png)

<p> A boilerplate project & guide to quickly start building with Polygon & The Graph. Ideal for hackathons. </p>

Learn how to do the following:
* Create, compile & deploy a smart contract to the Polygon Mumbai testnet using Hardhat.
* Verify your smart contract using Polygonscan API.
* Interact with your deployed smart contract from your front-end using Wagmi React Hooks.
* Use Web3Storage to store images & user data.
* Create, compile and deploy a Subgraph to The Graph's Hosted Service.
* Query your Subgraph from your front-end using GraphQL to display blockchain & ipfs data.

Deliverables:

# üõ† Environment Variables & Wallet Setup

#### Create a Dev Wallet with Metamask, an Alchemy Account, a Web3Storage Account and a PolygonScan Account
* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) 
  * IMPORTANT: It's recommended to create a wallet for development purposes only, avoid using your regular wallet!
  * Save your private key(s) & seed phrase (mnemonic) in your notes.
* [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
  * Generate an API key for mumbai.
  * Save your API keys & url in your notes.
* [PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/apis)
  * Generate a PolygonScan API key.
  * Save your API key in your notes.
* [Web3Storage](https://web3.storage/)
  * Generate a Web3Storage API key.
  * Save your API key in your notes.
  
> **Why do we need these API keys?**
> An API key is a unique combination of letters & numbers that authorizes our project to make requests to the service we want to use such as Alchemy, PolygonScan, and Web3Storage! Essentially, it's a key to unlock access. ‚ú®

#### Add the Test Networks for Polygon Mumbai in Metamask:
* How to add Polygon Mumbai Testnet: https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/

> **What's a <i>Test Netowork</i>?**
> Using Polygon Mainnet costs real money, but there exists Test Networks or 'Testnets' such as Polygon Mumbai that developers use to test their smart contracts and it costs fake money (test money). All blockchains have their own testnets.

#### Fund Your Account(s) with fake MATIC:
* [Polygon Faucet (Mumbai Network)](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)

> **What's a<i>faucet?</i>?**
> A faucet is a place where you can request test money to test your DApp. There are limits on how much you can recieve on a daily basis.

#### Set Your Environment Variables:

```bash
# Navigate inside the 'hardhat' folder
cd packages/hardhat 
# Copy the contents of .env.example to .env.local
cp .env.example .env.local

# Navigate inside the 'next-app' folder
cd packages/next-app
# Copy the contents of .env.example to .env.local
cp .env.example .env.local
```
* Fill out the variables inside `.env.local` using your keys, urls, and seed phrase you saved.

> **Why do we need to set environment variables?**
> In our .env.local file is where we will store the API keys, urls, and seed phrase that our DApp will use. It's good practice not to expose these values in our code and store them in a file that will be hidden. That way, when we push to GitHub, our Accounts with fake money won't get drained. (Yes, they drain accounts on Testnet)
